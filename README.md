## Why?

Born in November 2022, icariusOS is my personal deep dive into the fascinating world of operating system internals. Built entirely from scratch, it's not just a project—it’s a commitment.

I've written kernels before, but life had other plans—until now. With icariusOS, I promised myself I'd see it through to the end. Is there even an end to operating systems? It started as a homemade bootloader and has evolved into a clean GRUB-booting OS that runs flawlessly on real 32-bit hardware.

Crafted with love by an IT professional deeply passionate about bare-metal hacking. Paging, syscalls, context switching, interrupt handlers, memory allocators—you name it, I've built it. icariusOS is my way of truly understanding operating systems—not just reading about them, but actually making it happen.

This is OS development done the right way—by getting your hands dirty. 🛠️✨

## ✨ Features

### 🔧 Architecture & Memory
- ✅ **HIGHER-HALF KERNEL**: Mapping at `0xC0000000`
- ✅ **MEGA PAGES**: 4 MiB Paging via **Page Size Extension (PSE)** 🔥
- ✅ **MEMORY ISOLATION**: User and Kernel **FULLY SEPARATED** using **CR3 Task Switching**
- ✅ **RING 3 TASKS**: Each Task has its **own Page Directory**

### 🧠 Tasking & Scheduling
- ✅ **ROUND-ROBIN POWER**: Custom Task Queue 
- ✅ **PREEMPTIVE MULTITASKING**: Scheduler fires **AUTOMATICALLY** via `IRQ0 → scheduler_schedule()`
- ✅ **SYSCALL MAGIC**: User Requests via `int 0x80`
- ✅ **STACK POWERHOUSE**: Supports up to **16 THREADS per Userspace Task** 

### 📦 Memory Management
- ✅ **SMART KERNEL HEAP**: Chunking, Coalescing & **Detailed Stats**
- ✅ **REAL USERSPACE ALLOCATOR**: Dynamic `malloc()` & `calloc()` (**NO MORE Bump Allocator!**)
- ✅ **PAGE FAULT HANDLER**: Diagnostics – **FIND & FIX ISSUES QUICKLY** + **STACKDUMP!**

### 🖥️ Userspace Support
- ✅ **FULL USERSPACE ISOLATION**: 4 MiB for **CODE**, **BSS**, **HEAP**, **STACK** 
- ✅ **icarSH**:  
  `ls`, `cat`, `echo`, `exit`, `help`, `history`
- ✅ **DYNAMIC USER HEAP**: Best-Fit Allocator – **Memory managed RIGHT**

## 🧩 DEPENDENCIES

- ✅ UBUNTU or WINDOWS via WSL – Latest LTS Recommended
- ✅ CROSS-COMPILER – You'll need a freestanding i686 toolchain:

```bash
./i686.sh
```

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED

```bash
./build.sh && ./fat16.sh

```
## 🛠️ BUILD & RUN

```bash
./build.sh && qemu-system-i386 -m 4G -drive format=raw,file=./ICARIUS.img
```

## 🔁 KERNEL UPDATE

Replace the Kernel Binary in your FAT16 Disk Image with a new BUILD.

```bash
./swap.sh && qemu-system-i386 -m 4G -drive format=raw,file=./ICARIUS.img
```

## 🧠 Kernel Debugging (QEMU + GDB)

```bash
./swap.sh && qemu-system-i386 -m 4G -s -S ./ICARIUS.img
gdb -x ./.gdbinit ./bin/ICARIUS.BIN
```

## 🔍 Userspace Debugging

```bash
./swap.sh && qemu-system-i386 -m 4G -s -S ./ICARIUS.img
gdb -x ./.gdbinit ./bin/ICARIUS.BIN
break *0x0
file ./src/user/icarsh/elf/icarsh.elf
```

## 🐚 Build the Userspace Shell ICARSH.BIN

```bash
make icarsh && ./fat16.sh
```

## 🌲 Dir Structure

```bash
tree | xclip -selection clipboard
```

## 🤖 YOLO DevOps Pipeline

```bash
git checkout dev && git pull origin dev && git merge scheduler && git push origin dev && \
git checkout main && git pull origin main && git merge dev && git push origin main 
```
