Exploring the world of operating systems is like a cool journey through the Matrix. Every driver created and every code written feels like the discovery of secrets in an as yet unknown digital world. Even in this small "toy kernel" is the magic that determines how our technical world works.

It's not just about typing in bytes and commands. It becomes the feeling of an architect of a small but exciting digital world üåê . Sometimes time passes unnoticed in the creation of this digital world. Oh yes, the development of operating systems is indeed very time-consuming. ‚è≥

## archievements üöÄ

1. **bootloader:**
   Smooth system startup achieved with a functional bootloader

2. **ata driver:**
   Successfully reads LBA sector from the hard drive, loading the kernel into memory at 0x010000.

3. **protected mode transition:**
   Seamless transition to Protected Mode (32-bit) with A20 Gate activation for full 32bit memory utilization.

4. **interrupts:**
   Implemented the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) for handling interrupts.

5. **pic:**
   Implementing the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) to handle Interrupt Requests (IRQ).

6. **extend vga driver**
   Add a functionality to scroll.

7. **heap - memory magic unleashed**
   Introducing a function to dynamically allocate memory with flair, something like "kheap(50)" for 50 bytes, aligning the allocation in cpu cache friendly 4096-byte blocks.

8. **logo**
   Integrate a function for printing initialization messages and unveil an elegant logo. This makes starting the system a visual experience! :D

## next step üõ†Ô∏è

9. **heap - deallocation**
   The next step is to implement a deallocation function. To give the spirit of liberation a spell with something like "kfree(ptr)" to free the memory.
