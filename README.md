- Booted with GRUB2 bootloader
- Runs on i686 architecture

I've loved technology and all its different parts since I was a kid. It makes me really happy when, after trying different things for a long time, I finally figure out a solution to a problem and see things that were made completely from the beginning. Making an operating system, especially, is likely one of the biggest challenges you can take on with a computer. For me, it's just pure joy in the world of IT, and that excitement always keeps me motivated to keep working on the icariusOS project. ðŸ˜Š

# achievements 

- [x] Bootloader: Smooth system startup with a custom-written bootloader.
- [x] ATA Driver: Reads LBA sectors from the hard drive, loading the kernel into memory at 0x010000.
- [x] Protected Mode: Seamlessly transitioned to Protected Mode (32-bit) with A20 Gate activation for full 32-bit memory utilization.
- [x] Interrupts: Implemented the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) for handling interrupts.
- [x] PIC: Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) to handle Interrupt Requests (IRQ).
- [x] VGA Driver: Added scroll functionality within the VGA text mode.
- [x] Heap Magic: Introduced a dynamic memory allocation function like "kheap(50)," aligning allocations in CPU cache-friendly 4096-byte blocks.
- [x] Logo: Integrated a function for printing initialization messages and unveiled an elegant logo, transforming system startup into a visual experience! ðŸ˜„
- [x] Heap Deallocation: Enabled the release of memory with "kfree(ptr)."
- [x] Paging: Dynamically optimized virtual memory by efficiently managing pages between RAM and disk, unlocking the potential to create the illusion of each process having its own address space.
- [x] ATA Read in Interrupt Mode: Successfully implemented interrupt-driven reading of data from the ATA disk, avoiding constant polling that slows down and blocks the CPU.
- [x] kprintf Upgrade: Implemented a printing function, enhancing the system's ability to communicate and display information.
- [x] CMOS Date Reading: Successfully implemented a date reading function from the CMOS.
- [x] Real Ksleep with Timer: Used PIT to create a real ksleep function.
- [x] Keyboard Driver (In Progress): Currently implementing the QWERTZ keyboard layout for enhanced user input compatibility.
- [x] Multiboot2 Integration: Integrated the GRUB bootloader to support the Multiboot2 spec, removing the self-made bootloader.
- [x] Memory Map Mastery: Successfully read the memory map from Multiboot2.
- [x] Message of the Day: Created a captivating and sexy message of the day! ðŸ˜Ž
- [x] kprintf Refinement: Improved kprintf and fixed bugs in %s and %d functionalities.
