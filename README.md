icariusOS is my personal, experimental x86 kernel. I am building this operating system to better understand how an OS really works ‚Äì from the ground up. It is a big challenge, because I have full control over the whole system ‚Äì and that makes it very exciting!

Think about it: drawing to the framebuffer, managing memory, building a file system ‚Äì doing all of this in your own kernel is not easy. In 32-bit mode, things are more detailed and maybe a bit old-school. You must work with limited memory and smaller resources ‚Äì but that makes it even more interesting for me.

Why did I choose 32-bit instead of 64-bit? It was a practical decision. For 32-bit kernels, there are many more tutorials, documentation and example projects. That makes learning easier and helps me understand faster.

Of course, I know that a hobby kernel will never compete with Linux or Windows ‚Äì one lifetime is not enough for that üòâ. But that‚Äôs not my goal anyway.

I don‚Äôt want to create the next big Linux. This is about fun, challenge and learning. I am building my own operating system from scratch, step by step ‚Äì and I enjoy writing every single line of code.

  `ls`, `cat`, `echo`, `exit`, `help`, `history`
- ‚úÖ **DYNAMIC USER HEAP**: Best-Fit Allocator

## üß© DEPENDENCIES

- ‚úÖ UBUNTU or WINDOWS via WSL ‚Äì Latest LTS Recommended
- ‚úÖ CROSS-COMPILER ‚Äì You'll need a Freestanding i686 Toolchain:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: ALWAYS RUN SCRIPTS FROM THE ROOT DIR (`./`)  

```bash
./scripts/build/i686.sh
```

## üõ†Ô∏è BUILD & RUN

```bash
make icarsh && ./scripts/build/build.sh && ./scripts/build/fat16.sh
```

```bash
qemu-system-i386 -m 4G -drive format=raw,file=./ICARIUS.img
```

## üîÅ KERNEL UPDATE

Replace the Kernel Binary in your FAT16 Disk Image with a new BUILD.

```bash
./scripts/tools/swap.sh && qemu-system-i386 -m 4G -drive format=raw,file=./ICARIUS.img
```

## üß† Kernel Debugging (QEMU + GDB)

```bash
./scripts/tools/swap.sh && qemu-system-i386 -m 4G -s -S ./ICARIUS.img
gdb -x ./.gdbinit ./bin/ICARIUS.BIN
```

## üîç Userspace Debugging

```bash
./scripts/tools/swap.sh && qemu-system-i386 -m 4G -s -S ./ICARIUS.img
gdb -x ./.gdbinit ./bin/ICARIUS.BIN
break *0x0
file ./src/user/icarsh/elf/icarsh.elf
```

## üå≤ Dir 

```bash
tree | xclip -selection clipboard
```
