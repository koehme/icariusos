# Overview

The VGA driver efficiently manages the VGA framebuffer, allowing for character and color rendering on the display. The codebase exhibits modularity, with separate functions for essential tasks such as character rendering, scrolling, and cursor control, promoting readability and maintainability.

One notable feature is the cursor control, offering functions to set and dynamically update its position as characters are written to the display. The driver supports display clearing, providing a clean canvas, and dynamic scrolling ensures content shifts upward when the cursor reaches the visible area's end.

Intelligent character writing, including handling newline characters and backspace, enhances overall readability. The VGA display initializes with critical parameters, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent operations.
