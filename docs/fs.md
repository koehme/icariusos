# File System

## Requirements

* The ATA driver: Was successfully implemented and the data read from the ATA disk was stored in the ata_disk.buffer. This buffer contains the content retrieved from the ATA disk, which I could now access and use if needed. I have also implemented a way to display the buffer when the read operation is complete.

## Overview

The Virtual File System (VFS) is a crucial abstraction layer in icariusOS that allows seamless integration and utilization of various file systems. This documentation provides an overview of the VFS implementation and serves as a resource for developers looking to contribute to the file system support in the kernel.

## Features

* File System Abstraction: The VFS enables [Your Kernel] to work with different file systems without the need to rewrite the core of the operating system each time.
* Dynamic Driver Loading: The VFS implementation allows file system drivers to be dynamically loaded at runtime, enhancing flexibility and extensibility.
* Generic Interface: The generic interface of the VFS defines fundamental operations such as opening, closing, reading, and writing files, facilitating the integration of new file systems.

## Usage

To utilize the VFS follow the instructions outlined in the developer documentation. Here are some basic steps:

* Add File System Drivers: Implement a file system driver that adheres to the generic interface of the VFS.
* Load Drivers: Dynamically load the file system driver at runtime using the provided functions.
* Invoke File System Operations: Utilize the generic interface of the VFS to invoke file system operations such as opening, reading, and writing files.
