🧾 Commit Guidelines

🗣️ Language
Please write commit messages in English – your future self (and others) will appreciate the clarity.

✍️ Content
Don’t just say what you changed – also tell us why.
Good: "Fix: prevent crash when loading empty FAT16 directory"
Bad: "fix bug"

🧘 Style
No strict formatting rules here. Just keep things readable and consistent.
Snake case, camel case, yelling in all caps? As long as it makes sense, it's cool.
